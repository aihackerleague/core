# Prompt Engineering Documentation

## Creating Prompts
1. Define the task clearly
2. Provide context and examples
3. Specify the desired output format
4. Test prompts with various inputs

## Optimizing Prompts
- Use clear and concise language
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Iterate based on AI responses
- Fine-tune temperature and max tokens settings

## Common Errors
- API rate limiting: Implement exponential backoff
- Incomplete responses: Adjust max tokens or break into multiple requests
- Context length exceeded: Summarize or chunk input data

## Real-World Examples
### Judging System Prompt
```
