# Security Best Practices

## Environment Variables

Proper management of secrets is crucial for maintaining the security of your application. This project uses environment variables to handle sensitive information such as API keys for OpenAI and Supabase.

### Setting up .env files

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add your secret keys to this file in the following format:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

3. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information to your repository.

### Accessing Environment Variables

In your Vite.js application, you can access these environment variables using `import.meta.env`:

```javascript
const openAIKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY;
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
```

## Data Protection

When working with AI-powered features, it's essential to handle user data securely:

1. Minimize data collection: Only collect and process the data necessary for the application's functionality.
2. Encrypt sensitive data: Use encryption for storing and transmitting sensitive information.
3. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
4. Regularly delete unnecessary data: Implement data retention policies and delete data that is no longer needed.

## Audit Tools

Regularly auditing your project's dependencies for vulnerabilities is crucial. Use the following tools:

### npm audit

Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
```

To fix vulnerabilities automatically (when possible), run:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

### Snyk

Snyk is an external security monitoring service that can help identify and fix vulnerabilities in your project:

1. Sign up for a Snyk account at https://snyk.io/
2. Install the Snyk CLI:

```bash
npm install -g snyk
```

3. Authenticate with Snyk:

```bash
snyk auth
```

4. Test your project for vulnerabilities:

```bash
snyk test
```

## Production Environment Security

When deploying your application to a production environment, consider the following security measures:

### HTTPS

Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit. Most modern hosting providers offer automatic HTTPS configuration.

### Security Headers

Implement security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities. You can use a middleware like Helmet.js to set these headers automatically:

```javascript
import helmet from 'helmet';

app.use(helmet());
```

This will set various security headers, including:

- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Content-Security-Policy

### Access Control

Implement proper access control mechanisms:

1. Use strong authentication methods (e.g., JWT with short expiration times).
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive operations.
3. Use the principle of least privilege: only grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes.

### Regular Updates

Keep all dependencies, including Vite.js, OpenAI SDK, and Supabase client library, up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

### Logging and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents quickly:

1. Use a centralized logging system to collect and analyze logs from all parts of your application.
2. Set up alerts for suspicious activities or error patterns.
3. Regularly review logs and access patterns to identify potential security issues.

By following these security best practices, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your Vite.js project with AI-powered features.
