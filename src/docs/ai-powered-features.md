# AI-Powered Features

The AI Hacking League leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to enhance various aspects of the competition. This document outlines the key AI-powered features that make our platform unique and innovative.

## AI Judging System

Our AI Judging System is designed to evaluate code submissions quickly and objectively based on multiple criteria:

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality (40%)**: How well does the solution solve the given problem?
2. **Innovation (30%)**: Does the solution present novel approaches or creative use of AI technologies?
3. **Efficiency (20%)**: How optimized and performant is the code?
4. **Code Quality (10%)**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and following best practices?

### Technical Implementation

- **API Integration**: We use OpenAI's GPT-4 model through their API to analyze code submissions.
- **Custom Prompts**: We've developed specialized prompts that instruct the AI to focus on specific aspects of code evaluation.
- **Scoring Algorithm**: A weighted scoring system calculates the final score based on the AI's evaluation of each criterion.

### Feedback Generation

The AI generates detailed feedback for each submission, including:
- Strengths and weaknesses of the solution
- Suggestions for improvement
- Comparative analysis with top-performing submissions (anonymized)

## Real-time Collaboration

AI enhances team collaboration through several features:

### Automated Task Suggestions

- **Algorithm**: Uses natural language processing to analyze project requirements and team member profiles.
- **Implementation**: Integrates with project management tools via APIs to suggest task allocations based on skills and workload.

### Intelligent Code Correction

- **Real-time Analysis**: AI continuously analyzes code as it's written, suggesting improvements and catching potential bugs.
- **Integration**: Implemented as a VS Code extension that communicates with our AI backend for real-time suggestions.

### Conflict Resolution

- **Merge Conflict Assistance**: AI analyzes conflicting code changes and suggests optimal resolutions.
- **Implementation**: Integrated with Git workflows, providing AI-powered suggestions during merge processes.

## Dynamic Leaderboards

Our leaderboard system updates in real-time as challenges are solved and evaluated.

### Technical Approach

1. **API Integration**: RESTful API endpoints for submitting scores and retrieving leaderboard data.
2. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time updates pushed to clients using WebSocket protocol.
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis used for caching leaderboard data to ensure fast retrieval and updates.

### Ranking Algorithm

- Utilizes an Elo-inspired rating system, adapted for coding challenges.
- Factors in challenge difficulty, solving time, and code quality scores.

### Implementation Details

- Backend: Node.js with Express for API endpoints and Socket.io for WebSocket communication.
- Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user scores and challenge data.
- Caching: Redis for in-memory caching of current leaderboard state.

## Skill Assessment

Our AI-powered skill assessment system provides detailed insights into each participant's coding abilities.

### Analysis Components

1. **Coding Style Analysis**: Evaluates consistency, readability, and adherence to best practices.
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies common coding patterns and assesses their appropriateness.
3. **Efficiency Metrics**: Analyzes time and space complexity of solutions.
4. **Language Proficiency**: Assesses mastery of language-specific features and idioms.

### Technical Implementation

- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes GPT-4 for natural language analysis of code comments and documentation.
- **Custom ML Models**: Trained on a large corpus of code to detect patterns and assess efficiency.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Incorporates tools like ESLint and Pylint for language-specific analysis.

### Feedback Generation

- Generates a comprehensive skill report after each challenge.
- Provides personalized improvement suggestions and learning resources.
- Tracks progress over time, highlighting areas of improvement and newly acquired skills.

### API Integration

- RESTful API endpoints for submitting code for analysis and retrieving skill assessment reports.
- Webhook support for integrating skill assessments into external learning management systems or IDEs.

By leveraging these AI-powered features, the AI Hacking League provides a unique, engaging, and educational competitive coding experience that continuously adapts and improves based on participant interactions and performance.
