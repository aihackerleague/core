2. Badges and Achievements: Specific accomplishments are recognized through a system of badges and achievements.
3. Leadership Roles: Leadership positions are filled based on demonstrated skills, contributions, and community trust.

## Evaluation Process

1. Regular Assessments: Member contributions are assessed regularly through peer reviews and objective metrics.
2. Feedback: Members receive constructive feedback on their performance and areas for improvement.
3. Appeals: A fair process is in place for members to appeal evaluation decisions.

## Balancing Meritocracy and Inclusivity

1. Mentorship: Experienced members are encouraged to mentor newcomers.
2. Diversity Considerations: We actively work to identify and remove barriers that may prevent underrepresented groups from fully participating in the meritocratic system.
3. Holistic Evaluation: While technical skills are important, we also value soft skills, community building, and other forms of contribution.

## Continuous Improvement of the System

1. Regular Review: The meritocracy system itself is reviewed annually to ensure it remains fair and effective.
